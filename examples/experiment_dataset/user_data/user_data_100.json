His quiet, observant nature means he prefers deep dives into forum discussions on wealth distribution or the societal impact of AI over large, noisy parties.

He's fiercely curious, slightly contrarian, and gets bored easily unless he's mentally stimulated. His humor is dry and sarcastic, and he collects niche interests, from the history of medical misinformation to the architecture of data centers.
